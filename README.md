# ✨❤️ Hi there! ❤️✨

My name is Hilary - I'm a **software developer** that has been exploring the depths of **JavaScript fullstack development** for over 3 years now (using mostly **React**, **TypeScript**, **Node**, **GraphQL** and **PostgreSQL**), and coded in Python and C prior to that.

React, GraphQL, and PWAs are my current love interests. ⚛💛

My primary hobby is weightlifting and I plan on doing **competitive bodybuilding** once the pandemic ends. 💪😎
